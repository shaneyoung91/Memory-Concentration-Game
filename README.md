# DOG MEMORY (SEI Lovelace Edition)
    
A Memory/Concentration game starring the pups of the SEI Lovelace Cohort.

The objective of the game is to find all six pairs of cards before the time runs out. The game consists of 12 cards arranged in a grid, face-down initially. The player needs to click on two cards at a time to reveal their faces. If the two revealed cards match, they remain face-up. Otherwise, they are flipped back face-down, and the player can try again.
